file downloads:

    Selenium does NOT support testing file downloads. File download triggers a windows which comes from the OS and selenium cannot automate native OS windows

    There tools that can automate native windows:    
        AutoIT --> only works on WIndows 
        Robot framework  --> java library, works anywhere where java works
        Sikuli   -> works windows, unix  

    We can use java to verify if file exists in certain folder.    
    We can use java to read and verify contents certain files.

File upload:

Selemium supports file uplaod opertations. 
1. To upload a file using selenium, we need to locate the element which opens the pop up window.  it has to have tag INPUT. then using the sendKeys method, pass the full path of the file which you want to upload. 
2. click on the upload button



ACTIONS

Actions is a Selenium api/library/class which provide advances user interactipns. 
    double click
    drag drop
    hover
    click
    keyboard combinations


To use aciopms, we need to create actions object by passing a webdriver object as a constructor.

doubleClick  --> double clicks on an element


moveToElement== the mouse on top of the target element
dragAndDrop  --> moves element on top of another element



scrolling is achieved using different ways

    action.sendKeys(Keys.PAGE_DOWN).perform();;
    action.sendKeys(Keys.ARROW_DOWN).perform();;
    action.moveToElement(eleemnt).perform();


cod for scrolling down using javascript:     
((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", element)


actions can be chained. 
    actions.moveTo.click.moveto....

    build() --> a method that is used to create a single action from all the actions. 
    perform() --> perfoms the action
