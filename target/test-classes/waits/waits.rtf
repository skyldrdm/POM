\f0\fs24 \cf0 Thread.sleep()\
    this is not a selenium sleep\
    it is from java itself, used to pause the execution of a program\
\
\
implicit wait\
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\
\
        One time configuraition, we set once and it alwyas applies\
\
        only works with findElement method\
        if the findElement cannot locate element, it will keep trying untill it finds the element or time runs out. if findElement cannot find the element after time exporires, it will throw NoSuchElementException\
\
        if findElement method finds the element after 1 second, it will not wait for the remaining time\
\
explicit wait\
    waiting for certain condition to happen.\
    it does not apply globally like implicit\
\
    it needs the be called explicitly when we want to do the operation\
\
    explicit wait needs to be told what to wait for. wait conditions come form the ExpectedConditions class\
\
fluent wait\
\
    is jsut like explicit, but we can make the wait more customized. we can specify how often it should poll, what exceoptions should be ignored}
